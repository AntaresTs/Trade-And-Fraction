If you don't know the server in question or are reading this after the year 2020 (which at the time this was written, is already the case) then chances are that this project doesn't concern you and I will not answer any questions. If people keep annoying me over this old-ass project, I'll just delete it and deny ever being involved. It is what it is, I won't continue working on it and I don't even know how most of it works, and quite frankly I do not care.
